# classification_01
The data is taken from https://github.com/manishchet/Acqwire-predict-whether-a-startup-will-suceed-or-not . It is no more valid but you can download it. We had no further variable description for the data. The exploratory part is shortened for time efficiency concerns. Traditional logistic regression modelling is used since it is the fundamental model for classification modeling. This work is aimed to examine the steps of a logistic regression modeling better and compare the 5-fold cross validation and train-validation and test split. Every section is detailed with explanations for ease of the reader. Results are shown in the brief report.
