# classification_01
The dataset used in this project was obtained from this repository:https://github.com/manishchet/Acqwire-predict-whether-a-startup-will-suceed-or-not. Although the original link is no longer active, the dataset remains available for download. The primary objective of this project is to systematically demonstrate the workflow of traditional logistic regression modeling and to compare different evaluation approaches, as logistic regression serves as a fundamental model for classification algorithms. Our workflow in this project is outlined as:

* Research Question Setting: Defining main research questions.
* Data Manipulation: Starting the analysis with data cleaning and preprocessing..
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Due to the absence of detailed variable descriptions, the exploratory data analysis (EDA) section has been kept concise to maintain time efficiency.
* Feature Engineering: We tried to perform a preliminary variable selection process to enhance the model performance. 
* Modeling: As a fourth step traditional logistic regression model was applied, since it is serving as the fundamental method for binary classification tasks. As a modeling technique 5-fold cross-validation, train-validation-test split processes are also employed.
* Model evaluation:  Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.
* Model performance comparison and model inference: Comparing different models and summarising key findings.

Each step of the analysis is thoroughly explained to ensure clarity and accessibility for readers.
Key findings and results are summarised in a concise report.
This project is further extended in a separate repository titled "Supervised ML: Problem Classification".
In that study, the final logistic regression model developed here will be utilised as a baseline to evaluate and compare the performance of various supervised machine learning algorithms.
